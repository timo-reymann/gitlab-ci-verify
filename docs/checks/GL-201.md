# GL-201

Pages job does not contain artifacts with a public path.

# Cause

The special job called `pages` is used to publish GitLab Pages, based on the assumption an artifact with files from
`public/` exist.

# Fix

Make sure your `pages` job `artifacts` contain files located in `public/`.

```yaml
pages:
  # ... job config
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public/
```
