# GL-202

Pages job does not define artifacts.

# Cause

The special job called `pages` is used to publish GitLab Pages, based on the assumption an artifact with files from
`public/` exist.

# Fix

Make sure your `pages` job defines `artifacts` like this:

```yaml
pages:
  # ... job config
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public/
```
