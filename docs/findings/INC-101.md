# INC-101

Include pattern did not match any files

# Cause

A local include with a glob pattern (e.g., `.gitlab/ci/*.yml`) did not match any files in the repository.

# Fix

Check that:
- The glob pattern is correct and matches the intended file paths
- The files exist in the repository at the specified location
- The pattern syntax is valid (supports `*`, `?`, and `**` for recursive matching)

Common issues:
- Typos in the file path or pattern
- Missing file extensions in the pattern
- Incorrect directory structure
- Files not yet committed to the repository
