# INC-102

Include file could not be loaded

# Cause

A local include file could not be read from the filesystem. This can happen when:
- The file doesn't exist at the specified path
- The file exists but cannot be read (permission issues)
- The file path is malformed
- The file is not accessible in the current context

# Fix

Check that:
- The include file exists at the specified path
- The path is correctly spelled (check for typos)
- The file has appropriate read permissions
- For relative paths, verify they are resolved correctly from the including file's directory
- For absolute paths, verify they are resolved correctly from the project root

Common issues:
- File not committed to the repository
- Incorrect file path or typo in the include statement
- File exists in a different branch but not in the current one
- Insufficient file system permissions
